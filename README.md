# GMU Presentation by @pwnpope

This repository contains the materials and tools from a presentation delivered at George Mason University on the topic of Automated Program Analysis, with a focus on automated binary analysis using Binary Ninja.

The presentation covers:
- Challenges & Limitations: A deep dive into the inherent difficulties of automated binary analysis and strategies for overcoming them.
- Efficiency Gains through Automation: How automating the process of identifying vulnerabilities, bugs, and errors within binary code can enhance both speed and accuracy while minimizing human error.
- Introduction to BinGoggles: An overview of BinGoggles, a tool developed to augment automated analysis. Key features, capabilities, and its impact on improving the scope and precision of security assessments were discussed.

The goal of this project is to share insights into how automation can revolutionize program analysis, especially for security researchers and developers focused on vulnerability detection and code auditing.
